; How this works:
; When you pass an error code to an exception, a few things will happen:
; 1. The Language class will load the <language-country-errors> ini file.
; 2. The the error code will be used to pull the corresponding messages from Developer and Client sections.
; 3. The error hander will then log the Developer error to an error reporting system.
; 4. The client will be shown the Client error message.
; 5. The errror handler will complete and return execution.

; Follow the HTTP error code system RFC2817 (http://www.iana.org/go/rfc2817)
; with ranges of error codes for different types of error:
;  1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process
;  2xx: Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted
;  3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the request
;  4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
;  5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request

500 = "Bad query %s in %s on line %s"
501 = "Select statement failed '%s' in %s on line %s"

; Friendly message to the user.
[Client]
500 = "A error has occurred."
501 = "A error has occurred."
